## Part 1 - Bugs
**Bug Chosen: testReverseInPlace method in the ArrayExamples.java**
1. **Failer-inducing input**
```
@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace() {
  int[] input1 = {1,2,3};
  ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
  assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3,2,1}, input1);
}
```

2. **An input that doesn't induce a failure**
```
@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace() {
  int[] input1 = {3};
  ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
  assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3}, input1);
}
```

3. **Symptoms**<br>
Passed Test<br>
<img src = "passed.png"><br><br>
Failed Test<br>
<img src = "failed.png"><br><br>

4. **Code**<br>
Code Before
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
  for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
    arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
  }
}
```

Code After
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
  int[] temp = new int[arr.length];
  for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    temp[i] = arr[i];
  }
  
  for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
    arr[i] = temp[arr.length - i - 1];
  }
}
```

5. **Explanation of my solution**<br>
The original code does not work because it sets `arr[i]` to `arr[arr.length-i-1]`. However the second half elements of the array value will remin unchanged after the loop ends because the first half elements of the array are no longer their original value.<br>
For example, here is a demonstration on how the wrong method works<br>
`[1,2,3,4]`<br>
`[4,2,3,4]`: `arr[0] = arr[3]`<br>
`[4,3,3,4]`: `arr[1] = arr[2]`<br>
`[4,3,3,4]`: `arr[2] = arr[1]`<br>
`[4,3,3,4]`: `arr[3] = arr[0]`<br><br>
For the fixed function, I first create a temperaory array that copies all the elements of the original array over. Therefore, when we perform the setting line of code, we will use `arr[i] = temp[arr.length - i - 1]` instead of `arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1]` so that we will use the original value of each element from the temp array.<br>
For example, here is a demonstration on how the correct method works<br>
`[1,2,3,4]`<br>
`[4,2,3,4]`: `arr[0] = temp[3]`<br>
`[4,3,3,4]`: `arr[1] = temp[2]`<br>
`[4,3,2,4]`: `arr[2] = temp[1]`<br>
`[4,3,2,1]`: `arr[3] = temp[0]`<br><br>

## Part 2 - Researching Command
**Grep Command**<br>
**`grep -i`, --ignore-case: "Perform case insensitive matching.  By default, grep is case sensitive."**<br>
Example 1:<br>

Legal education debt, which tops $84,000 for the average new

The -i option is useful beacuse sometimes the keyword we are searcing for is being capitalized as the first word of a sentence. In order to receive all the line with matching pattern, we can use -i to ensure that we do not miss anything important.<br>

**`grep -r`, --recursive: "Recursively search subdirectories listed."**<br>
Example 1:<br>
```
wanfranek@Samsons-MacBook-Pro technical % grep -r "base pair" plos

The default grep command is intended to use on a file and search an specific pattern within that file. However, if we want to search the pattern for every file under the directory, we have to perform this command for (number of files) times. With the -r recursive search commnad line option, the terminal can automatically loop through each file within the given directory based on he given pattern and list everything out as one output.<br>

**`grep -o`, --only-matching: "Prints only the matching part of the lines."**<br>
Example 1:<br>
```
wanfranek@Samsons-MacBook-Pro About_LSC % grep -o "System" reporting_system.txt 
System
System
System
System
System
System
System
System
```
Example 2:<br>
```
wanfranek@Samsons-MacBook-Pro About_LSC % grep -o "programs" reporting_system.txt
programs
programs
programs
programs
programs
programs
programs
programs
programs
programs
programs

```

The -o command option is useful because it displays the matching part of the file in a very clear manner and the terminal result will become way more neater. As a result, the user can easily know how many times the pattern appears. The bad thing is we won't be able to know the sentence/context the keywrod belongs to.<br>

**`grep -l`, --files-with-matches: "Only the names of files containing selected lines are written to standard output."**<br>
Example 1:<br>
```
wanfranek@Samsons-MacBook-Pro government % grep -rl "height" Media
Media/The_State_of_Pro_Bono.txt
Media/Farm_workers.txt
```
Example 2:<br>
```
Media/Farm_workers.txt
wanfranek@Samsons-MacBook-Pro government % grep -rl "nothing" Media
Media/Legal_system_fails_poor.txt
Media/Higher_Registration_Fees.txt
Media/Making_a_case.txt
Media/Farm_workers.txt
Media/Greedy_Generous.txt
Media/Retirement_Has_Its_Appeal.txt
```

The -l command line option is really useful because it will display the **unique** files that contain the keyword under the targed directory. Even though some file has the keyword appearing multiple times, it will onyl be displayed once.<br>

I managed to find these 4 intersting command line options of `grep` by using `man grep` in the terminal.<br>
Here is a screenshot of what I recieved after inputting the command into the terminal:<br>
