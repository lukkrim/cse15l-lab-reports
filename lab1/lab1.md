## ls
- Command Line with No Argument<br>
<img src="ls.png" width = 50% height = 50%><br>
**Absolute path**: /Users/wanfranek/lecture1<br>
**Why the output**: It simply displays the content inside lecture 1 directory<br>
**Is it an error?**: The output is not an error because Hello.class, Hello.java, README, and messages all fall under the lecture 1 directory.



- Command with a path to a directory as an argument<br>
<img src="ls_directory.png" width = 50% height = 50%><br>
**Absolute path**: /Users/wanfranek/lecture1<br>
**Why the output**: It functions the same as the no argument example. It just uses an abosulete path to represent we want to see the content of the current working directory lecture 1.<br>
**Is it an error?**: The output is not an error because Hello.class, Hello.java, README, and messages all fall under the lecture 1 directory.



- Command with a path to a file as an argument<br>
<img src="ls_file.png" width = 50% height = 50%><br>
**Absolute path**: /Users/wanfranek/lecture1/README<br>
**Why the output**: ls shows the content of a directory, but the argument here is the path to a filename.<br>
**Is it an error?**: The output is not an error because when you try to ls [filename], it will just repeat the name of the file and any relative information requested.
